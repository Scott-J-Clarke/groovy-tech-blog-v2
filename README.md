# groovy-tech-blog-v2

## Description

"Dose of Daily Tech" is a blog where web developers can read, write, and respond to programming ideas.

It was built with JavaScript, Node.js, Handlebars, and SQL. The npm packages used include Express, MySQL2, Sequelize, dotenv, and bcrypt.

This code has:

- a login/signup page
- navigation bar with links to the homepage, dashboard, create a post, and logout.
- users can comment on other posts and edit or delete their own posts

Through building "Dose of Daily Tech" I:

- began to grasp the 'MVC' framework for building a full-stack web application
- became more familiar with writing routes and the 'render' method
- gained experience writing in 'try-catch' syntax
